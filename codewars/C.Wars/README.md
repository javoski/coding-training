[C.Wars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/cwars/train)

Normally we have firstname,middle and the last name but there may be more than one word in a name . Like a South indian one .

Similar to those kinda names we need to initiallize the names .

See the pattern Below
```js
initials('code wars') => returns C.Wars 
initials('Barack Hussain obama') => returns B.H.Obama
```
Complete the function initials.
